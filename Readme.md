The data sources will be from, 
- Goodreads (Books)
- Letterboxd (Movies)
- Glitchwave (Video Games)
- Steam (Video Games)
- Xbox (Video Games)? dk if this one is possible
- Audible
- Spotify (Music)
- Zotero (Classes/Textbooks)
- Youtube (Self Explantaory)
- Worldblog.stephenokita.com (places)

+ Suplemented by manual entry which will include my books in my room and records
id love to do something with drinks and food as well

Presentation Layouts:
- By date of consumption/first perception
- By only completed
- By unfinished
- By location (where it was published) 
- Would love to do a connenction thing to look at what inspired x work
