Okay this is a very difficult problem. 

In terms of what do I do every day I need to first look at the data I can gather. 
This is not the issue here, it is determining the storage and presentation of that data. 

Fundementally i think this needs to be a node based system to do maximum relation presentation. 

Things like 
- Date
- Location 
- Subject 
- Source/Valdiation mechanism (who was this with material evidence etc)
- Type of action
- Duration of action

Need to all be recorded but I think as a mechanism of storage, I don't want to have to semantic search every event in my life. While that might be reflective of schema theory, current semantic search engines are not good enough. 

So I think time-seris esc where a time is seprated into 
- Years
    - Months
        - Days
            - x
            - y
            - z 

With each `{x,y,z}` being a relativiley loose node. Theses will have a unified schema and additional material source linking to it (photos, videos, articles, location data etc) but still gives the flexibilitiy of something like a document based database just with a linear time based taxanomic structure.
